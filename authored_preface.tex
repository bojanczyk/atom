\chapter*{Preface}

This book is about algorithms that run on objects that are infinite, but finite up to certain symmetries.
Under a suitably chosen notion of symmetry, such objects -- called \emph{orbit-finite sets} -- can be represented, searched and processed just like finite sets. The goal of the book is to explain orbit-finiteness and demonstrate its usefulness. Most of the examples of orbit-finite sets are taken from automata theory, since this is where orbit-finite sets began.
